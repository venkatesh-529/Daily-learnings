# SQL – LeetCode Practice

## Problems Solved
- Find Loyal Customers
- DNA Pattern Recognition

## Key Concepts Used
- GROUP BY with HAVING
- COUNT aggregation
- Pattern matching
- Filtering grouped results
- String conditions

## What I Learned
- HAVING is used when filtering aggregated results instead of WHERE
- Loyalty-type problems usually reduce to counting repeated activity per user
- Pattern recognition queries often rely on string matching logic
- Aggregation queries become clearer when conditions are separated logically

## Mistake I Made
In the Loyal Customers problem, I initially tried filtering before grouping, which removed valid records.
Moving the condition into HAVING ensured filtering happened after aggregation.

## Queries to Remember

### Find Loyal Customers
```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
