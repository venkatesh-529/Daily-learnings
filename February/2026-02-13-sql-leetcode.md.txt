# SQL – LeetCode Practice

## Problems Solved
- Odd and Even Transactions
- Monthly Transactions

## Key Concepts Used
- Conditional aggregation
- CASE with SUM
- GROUP BY
- Date formatting for monthly grouping
- Aggregation with filtering

## What I Learned
- Conditional aggregation allows counting multiple categories in a single query
- CASE inside SUM is a powerful pattern for classification counts
- Monthly reports usually require extracting year and month from dates
- Aggregating first and filtering later leads to cleaner logic

## Mistake I Made
In the Monthly Transactions problem, I initially grouped by full date, which produced daily results instead of monthly totals.
Extracting year and month fixed the aggregation level.

## Queries to Remember

### Odd and Even Transactions
```sql
SELECT
    transaction_date,
    SUM(CASE WHEN amount % 2 = 1 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS odd_sum,
    SUM(CASE WHEN amount % 2 = 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS even_sum
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY transaction_date;
