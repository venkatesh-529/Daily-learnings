# SQL – LeetCode Practice

## Problems Solved
- Duplicate Emails
- Trips and Users

## Key Concepts Used
- GROUP BY with HAVING
- COUNT aggregation
- DELETE with subquery
- JOIN with filtering conditions
- DATE filtering

## What I Learned
- `GROUP BY` with `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` is the simplest way to detect duplicates
- Duplicate rows can be removed safely by keeping the record with the minimum id
- Filtering invalid users early in JOIN conditions simplifies queries
- Applying date constraints in WHERE clauses reduces unnecessary data processing

## Mistake I Made
In the Duplicate Emails problem, I initially tried deleting rows directly without isolating the ids to keep.
Using a subquery with `MIN(id)` ensured only duplicate rows were removed safely.

## Queries to Remember

### Duplicate Emails
```sql
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id)
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
);
