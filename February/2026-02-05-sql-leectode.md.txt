# SQL – LeetCode Practice

## Problems Solved
- Product Sales Analysis I
- Product Sales Analysis III

## Key Concepts Used
- INNER JOIN
- GROUP BY with aggregation
- MIN() to find first occurrence
- Combining grouped results with original tables

## What I Learned
- Joining fact tables (Sales) with dimension tables (Product) is a common analytics pattern
- `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions helps summarize data per entity
- Finding the first occurrence of a record often requires grouping with `MIN()`

## Mistake I Made
For Product Sales Analysis III, I initially grouped incorrectly and lost access to non-aggregated columns.
Using a subquery to first compute the minimum year per product and then joining back fixed the issue.

## Queries to Remember

### Product Sales Analysis I
```sql
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    s.year,
    s.price
FROM Sales s
JOIN Product p
ON s.product_id = p.product_id;
