# SQL – LeetCode Practice

## Problems Solved
- Market Analysis I
- Article Views I

## Key Concepts Used
- LEFT JOIN
- GROUP BY
- COUNT aggregation
- DISTINCT
- Filtering with WHERE conditions

## What I Learned
- LEFT JOIN is useful when we want to keep all users even if they have no related records
- Aggregations like COUNT must be grouped correctly to avoid inflated results
- DISTINCT is important when counting unique entities such as article views
- Filtering conditions should be applied carefully to avoid removing required rows

## Mistake I Made
In Market Analysis I, I initially used an INNER JOIN, which removed users with zero orders.
Switching to LEFT JOIN ensured that users with no orders were still included with a count of 0.

## Queries to Remember

### Market Analysis I
```sql
SELECT
    u.user_id AS buyer_id,
    u.join_date,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS orders_in_2019
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON u.user_id = o.buyer_id
AND o.order_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31'
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.join_date;
