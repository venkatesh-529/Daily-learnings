# SQL – LeetCode Practice

## Problems Solved
- Rank Scores
- Consecutive Numbers
- Rising Temperature

## Key Concepts Used
- Window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK)
- Self JOIN
- Date comparison using INTERVAL

## What I Learned
- `DENSE_RANK()` is preferred when equal values should share the same rank without gaps
- Consecutive row comparison can be handled using self JOINs or window functions like `LAG`
- Date-based problems often reduce to comparing today’s value with the previous day

## Mistake I Made
In the Rank Scores problem, I initially used `ROW_NUMBER()` which incorrectly assigned different ranks to equal scores.
Switching to `DENSE_RANK()` fixed the issue.

## Queries to Remember

### Rank Scores
```sql
SELECT score,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank
FROM Scores;
