# SQL – LeetCode Practice

## Problems Solved
- Employees Bonus
- Employees Missing Information

## Key Concepts Used
- IF vs CASE
- LEFT JOIN
- NULL handling using IS NULL

## What I Learned
- LEFT JOIN helps find missing records when one table has no matching row
- NULL comparisons must use IS NULL, not = NULL
- IF can be used to create conditional output columns

## Mistake I Made
I tried checking NULL values using `= NULL`, which never works.
The correct way is using `IS NULL`.

## One Query to Remember
```sql
SELECT e.employee_id
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Salaries s
ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
WHERE s.salary IS NULL
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
