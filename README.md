# Daily Learning Log

This repository tracks my daily learnings in:
- SQL (LeetCode practice)
- Core computer science concepts

## Structure
- Each day has a separate markdown file
- Files are organized by  month
- Focus is on concepts, mistakes, and reusable patterns — not just solutions

## Goal
Build consistency, reinforce fundamentals, and document real learning progress.
